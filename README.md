# FWI Synchronicity

This repository contains all the codes and data used for the Fire Weather Index (FWI) with observations (past and present) and perturbed (future). 
All codes are available and organized for reproducibility.

## Data

The data from the perturbed FWI simulations used in El Garroussi (2024b) are available in a public repository at Zenodo. You can access them through the following link:
